The idea is to write a full featured Story-writing system where users
can start to write parts of a story, and others can contribute to
create multiple trees with potentially multiple different endings.

Also, there will be a way to create styories where users can choose
what they do, and read on at the specific tree. [1]


KISS is the first doctrine. Ramaze is the framework.
