The idea is to write a full featured Story-writing system where users
can start to write parts of a story, and others can contribute to
create multiple trees with potentially multiple different endings.

what they do, and read on at the specific tree. [1]


Ruby the language; KISS is the doctrine; Ramaze is the framework.
